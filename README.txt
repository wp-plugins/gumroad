Display your Gumroad product pages in a pretty lightbox or embed them right in your posts using shortcodes.

== Description ==

This plugin lets you bring in the Gumroad product pages right onto your site, so that transactions can happen inline â€” without ruining the browsing experience for your customers.

The overlay option pops up the purchase form in a pretty lightbox.

The embed option shows the product purchase form directly on your page.

Shortcode examples:

`[gumroad id="demo"]`
`[gumroad id="demo" type="embed"]`
`[gumroad id="demo" text="Purchase Item" wanted="true"]`

Full shortcode documentation is in Settings > Gumroad after plugin is activated.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Full shortcode documentation is in Settings > Gumroad after plugin is activated.

Your theme must implement **wp_footer()** in the footer.php file, otherwise JavaScript will not load correctly. You can test if this is the issue by switching to a WordPress stock theme such as twenty-twelve temporarily.

If the overlay doesn't get triggered on click (and your browser is redirected to a gumroad.com URL), please make sure that there is not extra code that is hijacking the click event (for example, a Google Analytics onclick event).

A popular known plugin that does this is "Google Analytics for WordPress". Try unchecking one or both of these options: 1) Track outbound clicks & downloads, 2) Check Advanced Settings, then make sure "Track outbound clicks as pageviews" is un-checked.

See the official Gumroad [overlay](https://gumroad.com/overlay) or [embed](https://gumroad.com/embed) documentation for further troubleshooting.
